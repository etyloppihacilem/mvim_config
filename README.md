# NeoVim config

This config is forked from [jdhao/nvim-config](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config.git).

Quite some things have been modified.

# Install

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/etyloppihacilem/mvim_config ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/.config/nvim

```

This config requires `python3`, `npm`, `make`, `cmake` to be installed.
