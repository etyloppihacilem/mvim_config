# NeoVim config

This config is forked from [jdhao/nvim-config](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config.git).

Quite some things have been modified.

# Install

Do not use the `post_install.sh` script, it has not been update in some time...

You need to install nerd fonts, I recommend symbols only with `symbol_map` override on kitty for example, find the lastest on [kitty's website](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#kitty-is-not-able-to-use-my-favorite-font).

Install `vim-language-server` using
```bash
npm install -g vim-language-server
```
Install `python-lsp-isort`

Install `ripgrep` with your package manager, it is super useful anyway
